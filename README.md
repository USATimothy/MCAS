<h2>Analyzing educational data from the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System</h2>

I live in suburban Massachusetts, and I frequently hear someone say that Belmont/Andover/Lincoln/wherever has good schools. But what does that mean, quantitatively? Anecdotally, it means the students are academically proficient, with the assumption that the schools are the cause or at least the incubator of such proficiency.

Luckily for data nerds, the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests students in grades 3-10 in Mathematics, Science and English Language Arts and publishes results by school district. My analysis looks only at local school districts, i.e. those associated with a city or town school board, so that I can run correlations with town statistics. It excludes charter schools, agricultural and vocational schools, and private schools.

<p>Some questions to partially answer:<ul>
<li>Do the districts with highest absolute scores also have the highest improvement in scores between academic years?
<li>Is town wealth or school district spending more closely correlated with academic performance?
<li>Which schools perform better than expected given student profiles and town data?
</ul>
<p>There are many caveats, including:<ul>
<li>I'm not endorsing the idea that some districts are better than others overall, or that test scores are the best way of comparing them. I'm just curious about the phenomenon, since I hear people discussing it so often.<li>Some towns have more private and charter options than others; these schools often do not admit the highest needs students and can be very unbalanced in terms of demographics. This can make the remaining pool of public school students non-representative.<li>Students can opt out of taking the MCAS.<li>And of course, correlation does not imply causation.</ul>
